# Weihnachtsmarkt V1

## Description

**Weihnachtsmarkt** is a React SPA developed with NextJS framework, TypeScript and TailwindCSS. Used react-leaflet to create an interactive map. Different Christmas markets in and around Berlin are plotted on the map using react-leaflet. The user can find details about nearby Christmas markets by using their current location.

The data is obtained from [Open Data Berlin](https://daten.berlin.de/datensaetze/berliner-weihnachtsm%C3%A4rkte) <br>
The website design is heavily influenced by [Berliner Weihnachtsmarkt-Finder](https://weihnachtsmaerkte.odis-berlin.de/?id=)
